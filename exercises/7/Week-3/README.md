# Assignment

## Prerequisites
- [Install C++ Compiler](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp#_install-a-compiler)
- [Install VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Install VSCode C++ Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp#_install-the-extension)

## Recap from Lectures
- [Constructors](https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes/#constructors)
- [The 'this' keyword](https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/templates/#this)
- [Access modifiers](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/access-modifiers)
- [Overloading operators](https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/templates/#overloading_operators)

## Problems
- Write a C++ class that represents an abstract remote control. A remote control can report its battery charge (float), its model (char*), can move between channels, set a given channel, adjust the volume and open a menu(see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/oop-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-3/Examples/RemoteControlExample.cpp)).
- Write a group of C++ classes that represent a person (3 names, EGN), a bank transaction (source IBAN, target IBAN, amount) and a bank account (owner - person, current amount, history of transactions, current amount). Implement operations for processing transactions on the level of the account menu (see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/oop-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-3/Examples/BankingExample.cpp)).

## Solutions
Upload solutions in your GitHub folder (see: [how-to](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-commit)) (only .CPP files, no executable files)
